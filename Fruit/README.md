# Fruit Search 

- Plan and build an Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit! You may be familiar with autofill from a search engine like Google. 

- Populates the search bar with that suggestion.

- Small scale search bar which suggests various fruits based on user input.

- User’s typed input is contained anywhere in one of the fruits in the list, then a drop down will appear containing all the fruits which match.

- As a user continues to add letters to their input, new dropdowns will populate. When a user clicks on one of these options, it will populate in the search bar.
